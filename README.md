# EXE-CUSTOM
Simple payload from Gideon | iLightThings


So we have all used MS17 in metasploit to attack clients. But unfortunatley, even for old systems, AV can still catch your payload.
Uses EXE::CUSTOM, you can upload and execute your own custom payload.

Build that small executabled and run it with that, and you can simple walk right in.

Using*

set EXE::CUSTOM <path/to/payload.exe> will overwrite the metasploit payload and boom. A simple unscary binary to run with.
